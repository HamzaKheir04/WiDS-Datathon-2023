# Sub-seasonal Weather Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on improving sub-seasonal forecasts (15â€“45+ days) for temperature and precipitation using machine learning combined with physics-based weather models. The aim is to help communities and industries adapt to extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes.

## Project steps

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

   * Explore the dataset.
   * Check correlations and missing values.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Clean and prepare the data.
   * Handle missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.

3. **Model Training**

   * Train models (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, or others).
   

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Evaluate using metrics like RMSE
   * Compare with baseline 

5. **Hyperparameter Search (Optuna)**

   * Use Optuna to tune model parameters.
   * Save the best models and results.
